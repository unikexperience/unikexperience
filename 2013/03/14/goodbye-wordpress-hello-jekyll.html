		<p>Today, I moved my <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> blog to <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. It's one of the best decisions I've made for my blogging. Jekyll is a static-site generator built in Ruby by <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com">Tom Preston-Werner</a>. I actually had an idea similar to Jekyll about 2 years ago, but I never got the chance to hack on it and so I suggested it at a hackathon I recently attended in Manchester; everyone directed me to Jekyll. That was when I first heard of Jekyll, and shortly after, I knew it was worth a try. After much deliberation about going live with it, I pushed it and I'm not looking back.</p>

<p>So, why do I love Jekyll? <em>It is perfect by being imperfect</em> (you'll hear me saying that a lot). Jekyll isn't intuitive, but it is simple. Similarly, it's not popular, but it's incredibly stable. Within a few hours of building my new site, I knew this was exactly what I envisioned all those years ago. I can confidently say that I won't be going back to WordPress, ever (unless I'm held captive). I've quickly seen that WordPress has quickly grown into a content management system (or CMS) that's competing with the likes of Magento, Drupal and Joomla in efforts to boost its possible use cases (especially for the larger sites). I understand why, because that's where <em>the money is</em>, but as a long adopter, I feel like WordPress has lost its roots. <em>It's too good for it's own good</em>. I hate that I become distracted trying to see what new plugins and themes are available, even though I updated it last week. Computationally, without a doubt, it definitely makes it easier to blog. Psychologically, on the other hand, is what I'm questioning. I obviously think the latter is of bigger importance.</p>

<p>After writing my first blog post, I realized that I <em>could</em> concentrate on my content. I remember on WordPress, where I would always have nothing written up during those free hours I had to commit and to not have distractions is when you realize you didn't need those "convenient" features. Writing, like many human tasks in the digital age, require <strong>isolation for concentration</strong>. It's already well-publicized that humans have the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/1834682.stm">same attention span as goldfish</a>, so it would be pretty obvious to remove any potential distractions unless it's <strong>really</strong> (x 10&#94;10) mandatory.</p>

<p>I strongly believe the popularity of static-site generators like Jekyll will surge in popularity between 2013-14. We've already seen JavaScript and CSS3 capable of replacing server-side features such as <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>, <a href="http://livefyre.com">Livefyre</a>, <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/">Facebook Comments</a>, etc.) and analytics (<a href="http://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="http://mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a>, etc. I'm hosting my blog using <a href="http://appfog.com">AppFog</a>, though you're free to use GitHub Pages or Amazon S3. Benefits of using Jekyll are it becomes infinitely scalable, super-fast to render, higher uptime, easier to maintain and of course *mdash; increased focus!</p>

<p>Even though I'm a newbie at Jekyll, I have instantaneously felt its part in boosting my focus and productivity. Mix Jekyll with <a href="http://informationarchitects.net">iA Writer</a> and you'll write some fantastic stuff. I've even freely published the source powering this website <a href="http://github.com/bih/bilaw.al">on GitHub</a>. You'll be surprised by how easier your life becomes when <strong>it is not possible</strong> to be distracted by software.</p>
